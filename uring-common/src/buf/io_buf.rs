/// An `io-uring` compatible buffer.

/// The `IoBuf` trait is implemented by buffer types that can be used with
/// io-uring operations. Users will not need to use this trait directly.

///
/// Buffers passed to `io-uring` operations must reference a stable memory
/// region. While the runtime holds ownership to a buffer, the pointer returned
/// by `stable_ptr` must remain valid even if the `IoBuf` value is moved.
