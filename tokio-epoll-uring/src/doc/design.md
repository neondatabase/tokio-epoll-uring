# Design

The core insights behind this crate are:
* We can use Linux's new-ish `io_uring` facility to submit kernel-buffered reads from async Rust.
* To wait for completions, `io_uring` supports `epoll`ing of the file descriptor that represents an `io_uring` instance
  (This is a lesser-known but supported feature of io_uring).
* Vanilla `tokio` supports `epoll`ing arbitrary file descriptors in async Rust via [`tokio::io::unix::AsyncFd`].

Combine the above, and the result is this library:

1. Once: Create an io_uring instance.
2. Once: spawn a vanilla `tokio::task` that `epoll`s the io_uring instance for completions.
   We call this task the **poller task**.
3. For each IO:
 * Submit the IO operation to the io_uring instance without waiting for completions (`io_uring_enter` without `IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS`).
 * Implement a `Future` that gets woken up by **poller task** once the operation completes.

The core advantages compared to the various sketches in the *Motivation* section are:
* We can issue kernel-buffered read system from async Rust without risking blocking the executor thread.
* We avoid OS thread context switching in favor of intra-runtime tokio-task-switching, which has lower latency and lower CPU overhead.
* We can keep using vanilla `tokio`, as our design sits completely on top of it.

There is an extension to make this design more scalable on multi-core machines:
we can use one `io_uring` per executor thread. The vehicle for this _must_ be lazily-initialized
thread-locals, as `tokio` doesn't provide enough OS thread lifecycle hooks to do it another way.
While it's quite ugly, it avoids synchronizing on the submission path with significant performance benefits.
For completions, we continue to have one *poller task* per io_uring instance, spawned during
the lazy initialization of the thread-local.

## Critique

The tokio runtime has no idea of the high priority that the *poller task* has in the overall system.
If the system is under heavy load, the turnaround time for the *poller task* in the tokio scheduler will grow.
This means completion processing gets delayed, thereby transitively delaying `wake()` of the futures that issued these operations.
It would be beneficial to prioritize the *poller task* if the io_uring fd becomes EPOLLIN.

Further, in the one-io_uring-per-executor-thread extension to the design:
  1. There is no way to pin the *poller task* to the OS thread as the io_uring it corresponds to.
     This means the *poller task*s float freely among the executor OS threads.
     In a scenario where a read hits the page cache, the *poller task* will run on a different OS thread
     than where the read op was issued. So, tokio will have to do an (intra-runtime) cross-OS-thread `wake()`.
     Which is more expensive than if the *poller task* were on the same OS thread as the task that issued the read op.
     Sadly, there is [little hope](https://discord.com/channels/500028886025895936/500336333500448798/1131667951657955481)
     that OS-thread-affinity features will ever appear in vanilla tokio.
     It makes sense from an abstraction-cleanliness perspective, though.
  2. The `block_in_place` facility repurposes the current executor thread as a spawn_blocking-type thread.
     If we already created an io_uring instance in thread thread-local, that io_uring instance will now sit around useless
     until the thread exits or becomes a regular executor thread again. Tokio may also spawn new executor threads
     in the meantime, and these will have new io_uring instances in their thread-locals.
     So, we could end up with many more io_uring instances than executor threads in the system
     if `block_in_place` is used a lot. It's not a safety or liveness problem per se, and tokio
     _will_ eventually stop unused spawn_blocking-type threads, thereby cleaning up the unused io_urings.
     But it's an ugly wrinkle that wouldn't be necessary if we could fork `tokio` to integrate `epoll`ed `io_uring` more deeply.

However, despite these flaws, the benchmarks below show that the design is a vast improvement over [`tokio::fs`].
